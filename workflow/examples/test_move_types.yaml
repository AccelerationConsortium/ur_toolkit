name: "Move Type Test"
description: "Test both linear (moveL) and joint (moveJ) moves"

steps:
  - {action: "moveJ", position: "safe-home"}
  - {action: "gripper_activate"}
  - {action: "gripper_open"}
  
  # Linear move to approach position
  - {action: "moveL", position: "grasp-A-safe", speed: 0.1}
  
  # Joint move to final position (faster but curved path)
  - {action: "moveJ", position: "grasp-A", speed: 0.1}
  
  # Linear move for precise approach (straight line)
  - {action: "moveL", position: "grasp-A", speed: 0.05}
  
  - {action: "gripper_close"}
  - {action: "delay", duration: 1.0}
  
  # Joint move to lift (faster for large movements)
  - {action: "moveJ", position: "grasp-A-safe", speed: 0.1}
  
  # Joint move back home (fastest path)
  - {action: "moveJ", position: "safe-home"}
